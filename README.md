# Database-Design-Rules
Some rules to create a database structure  
I'm here to discuss some basic ideas for creating the best database design for organizations and what things we should notice while creating the database and its tables. Here, is my case study topic on the Johnson Car Dealership in Calgary. It is an imaginary company that I considered in this case study.
In this case study, I will cover some points which are the introduction, purpose, and goals, after that list of subjects and the tables that I showed in the case study, the attribute specification, then with a conclusion I will end this project.

An introduction Part shows that Johnson Motors has three dealerships in Over Calgary and they are thinking of upgrading their old database which lacks data sharing and causes conflict between their working employees. Explore the history, vision, and core values that drive our successful automotive dealership business. 

The purpose of Johnson Motors is to more focus on a Centralized relational database which helps them boost their sales also enhances customer satisfaction. By data, they will know the market trends what customers need, and the preferences of customers. They have also some goals like flexibility and scalability needed to grow the dealerships and want to keep track of vehicles that they sold and repaired.

Now, let's talk about the very important subjects in the database. Subjects are an entity of database means the which table shows which kind of data. If we choose the wrong entity then it may create a problem in the future, so choose an entity that shows clear data in database.
